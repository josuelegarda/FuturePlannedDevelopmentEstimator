# CE-UY 3013 Project Template

*This file presents a description of the final project. For your submission,*
*this file must serve as the documentation of your project, how your program*
*should be used along with examples.*

This program estimates future planned developments. To explain it further this program estimates the number of vehicle-trips for a planned office building of a input sq. ft. desired by the user by using the info of the list with the office spaces around that development. Its basically like a trip assessment for a development.Â 

Assumptions:
* The auto mode is 0.1, bus mode is 0.15, subway mode is 0.65, rail mode is 0.1
* Make sure that there is NO commas in the numbers in the csv file. The commas can interfere with data types. 






Inputs:
* A csv file with the office space of buildings in the studied area in sq. ft. and the Number of Employees per 1,000 Sq. Ft. 
* The building space (sq. ft.) to estimate how many vehicle-trips can exist in office building.

Outputs:
* A plot of with regression line office building space vs the total number of vehicle trips
* The number of vehicle-trips for the input building space (sq. ft.)

## Setup
In order to use the program, you have clone/download this repository,
navigate to the local directory and create a virtual environment with:

```
$ python -m venv venv
```
Then, activate the virtual environment:

'''
For Linux/Mac OS:
$ source venv/bin/activate

For Windows:
> venv\Scripts\activate
'''

Finally, install the required libraries for this program with:

'''
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

## How to use the program
First, as stated above make sure you have a csv file with a column, Office Space in (sq. ft.) and Number of Employees per 1,000 Sq. Ft..
Make sure none of these numbers have commas in it because it can interrupt with the datatypes.
Below is an example on how it should look:
